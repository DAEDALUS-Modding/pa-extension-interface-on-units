By default, PAEIOU expects the following files in each unit folder:
unit.json
si.png
image.png
meta.json
model.papa
move.anim.papa
animtree.json

If the unit has a weapon, PAEIOU expects it (by default) to be named in the following scheme:
0.weapon.json + 0.ammo.json
1.weapon.json + 1.ammo.json, etc.

You can change the defaults in meta.json, which can have the following fields, in any order:
{
    "unit": "(filename)"
    "si": "(filename)"
    "image": "(filename)",
    "model": "(filename)",
    "animtree": "(filename)",
    "move_anim": "(filename)",
    "weapons": [ 
                ["(weapon filename)", "(ammo filename)"],
                ["(weapon filename)", "(ammo filename)"]
    ]
    "include": ["(extra file 1)",
                "(extra file 2)"]
}

The "weapons" field can be a single string, a vector of strings, or a vector of vector of strings.

If "weapons" is a single string, the weapon file will be expected to be at (string).weapon.json, and the ammo file will be expected to be at (ammo).ammo.json.

If "weapons" is a vector of strings, the behavior will be the same, except the unit can have multiple weapons.

If "weapons" is a vector of vector of strings, you can specify the exact local filepath.

The "include" field is a vector of strings that accepts additional files.
